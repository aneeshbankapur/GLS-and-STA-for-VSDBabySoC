# STA-for-VSDBabySoC
## Introduction

**Static Timing Analysis** is one of the many techniques available to verify the timing of a digital design. 

An alternate approach used to verify the timing is the timing simulation which can verify the functionality as well as the timing of the design. 

The term timing analysis is used to refer to either of these two methods - static timing analysis, or the timing simulation. 

Thus, timing analysis simply refers to the analysis of the design for timing issues.

The STA is static since the analysis of the design is carried out statically and does not depend upon the data values being applied at the input pins. 

This is in contrast to simulation based timing analysis where a stimulus is applied on input signals, resulting behavior is observed and verified, then time is advanced with new input stimulus applied, and the new behavior is observed and verified and so on.

**OpenSTA** is an open source static timing analyzer (STA) tool used in digital design. It is utilized to analyze and verify the timing performance of digital circuits at the gate level.

OpenSTA uses a TCL command interpreter to read the design, specify timing constraints and print timing reports.

#### Timing Paths 

`What do you mean by Timing Paths?`
* It Refer to the logical paths a signal takes through a digital circuit from its source to its destination, including sequential and combinational elements. STA analyzes timing paths to determine their delay, setup and hold times, and other timing parameters specified in the constraints. Timing paths are categorized into combinatorial and sequential, and the critical path is the longest path in the design with the maximum operating frequency.

#### Timing Path Elements
   
Timing path elements in STA are the start point, where a signal originates, the end point, where it terminates, and the combinational logic elements, such as gates, that the signal passes through. Timing paths are traced to determine the overall delay and timing performance of the digital circuit.

**Start Point**: Is the point where the signal originates or enters the digital circuit. This point is typically an input port of the design, where the signal is first introduced to the circuit.

The start point of a timing path can be either:

- An input port, where data enters the design, or

- The clock pin of a register, where data is launched on a clock edge.

**End Point:** Is the point where the signal terminates or leaves the digital circuit. This point is typically an output port of the design, where the signal is outputted from the circuit.

The end point of a timing path can be either:

- A register's data input pin (D pin), where data is captured by the clock edge, or

- An output port, where data must be available at a specific time.

**Combinational Logic:** Combinational logic elements are the building blocks of a digital circuit and are used to perform logic operations on the signals passing through the circuit. These elements do not store any information, and the output of a combinational logic element is solely determined by the input values at that moment.

The diagram illustrates four distinct timing paths:

Path 1: Input to Register (in2reg)

Path 2: Register to Register (reg2reg)

Path 3: Register to Output (reg2out)

Path 4: Input to Output (in2out)

#### Setup and Hold Checks

-> **What is Setup Check?**
* Is the minimum time that the data must be stable before the clock edge, and if this time is not met, it can lead to setup violations, resulting in incorrect data being stored in the sequential element. The setup check is essential to ensure correct timing behavior of a digital circuit and prevent data loss or other timing-related issues.
* The setup time of a flip-flop depends on the technology node, operating conditions, and other factors. The value of the setup time is usually provided in the logic libraries.

-> **What is Hold Check?**
* Is the minimum amount of time that the data must remain stable after the clock edge, and if this time is not met, it can lead to hold violations, resulting in incorrect data being stored in the sequential element. The hold check is necessary to prevent issues such as data corruption, metastability, and other timing-related problems in digital circuits.

#### Slack Calculation 

Setup and hold slack is defined as the difference between data required time and data arrivals time. 

>Setup slack = Data required time - Data arrival time

>Hold slack = Data arrival time - Data required time

-> **What is Data Arrival Time?**
* The time taken by the signal to travel from the start point to the end point of the digital circuit. 

-> **What is Data Required Time?** 
* The time for the clock to traverse through the clock path of the digital circuit. 

-> **What is Slack?** 
* It is difference between the desired arrival times and the actual arrival time for a signal. 
* Positive Slack indicates that the design is meeting the timing and still it can be improved. 
* Zero slack means that the design is critically working at the desired frequency. 
* Negative slack means, design has not achieved the specified timings at the specified frequency.
* Slack has to be positive always and negative slack indicates a violation in timing.
